# Finetuning LLMs on Custom Datasets

Welcome to the Finetuning LLMs on Custom Datasets repository! 🌟🧠 This project provides a framework for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on custom datasets, enabling you to tailor powerful pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains.

## 📜 Overview

The Finetuning LLMs on Custom Datasets project offers tools and guidelines for adapting pre-trained LLMs to new tasks using your own datasets. This process enhances the model's performance on specific types of data, making it more relevant for specialized applications.

## 🚀 Features

- **Custom Dataset Integration:** Easily load and preprocess your custom datasets for finetuning.
- **Pre-trained Model Support:** Utilize a variety of pre-trained LLMs for finetuning, including models from popular libraries.
- **Training Scripts:** Predefined scripts for finetuning models with options for hyperparameter tuning and checkpointing.
- **Evaluation Tools:** Assess model performance using custom evaluation metrics and validation datasets.
- **Documentation and Examples:** Comprehensive documentation and example scripts to guide you through the finetuning process.

## 📥 Installation

To get started with Finetuning LLMs on Custom Datasets, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Finetuning-LLMs-on-Custom-Datasets.git
   cd Finetuning-LLMs-on-Custom-Datasets
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Dataset:**
   Follow the instructions in the `docs/dataset_preparation.md` file to format and prepare your custom dataset.

4. **Run the Finetuning Scripts:**
   Execute the finetuning script with your dataset:
   ```bash
   python finetune.py --dataset path/to/your/dataset --model_name your_pretrained_model
   ```
